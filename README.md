# Tic_tac

Well Tic tac toe needless to say is one of the most classic games we all have ever played.

This is a 2 player game where each player plays in a turn.

Rules:-

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.


2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.


3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.


4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

So what are you waiting for,

Just dive in and showcase your skills...

ALL THE BEST!!!
